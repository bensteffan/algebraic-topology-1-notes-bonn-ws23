% Set up externalization for TikZ pictures: figures/ is the subdir we want the figures stored in and we only want to externalize picture with an explicit given name.
% The reasoning behind that is that by default externalization will try to draw in anything using tikz, including tikzcd diagrams (on which it chokes, horribly) and stuff like mdframed environements.
% Moreover, it is good practice to give explicit names to pictures anyways since otherwise adding a picture somewhere in the middle of the document will mess up the default sequential name ordering TikZ goes with and cause recompilation of all following pictures, which in our case is extremely slow.

\section*{About These Notes}
This document contains lecture notes for the course \makeatletter\@course\makeatother\ taught in the winter term of 2023/24 at the University of Bonn by \makeatletter\@lecturer\makeatother.
The assistant is \makeatletter\@assistant\makeatother.

These notes are for private use. 
They are \strong{not} official lecture notes endorsed by the lecturer.
As such, errors and inaccuracies should generally be presumed my own. 

This document is not a character-for-character transcript of the lecture.
Changes to form (and, in places, to content) have been made to improve readability of these notes as a document.
In particular, I have taken the liberty to make adjustments to notation here and there to more closely align with my personal tastes and opinions.
At points, I have added additional context, explanations, computations, and so on.
These are clearly marked to that effect, although smaller changes (in particular minor nottation changes) and in-text additions (such as citations) are not.

\subsection*{Formatting}
This document has hyperlinks: References, footnote marks, table-of-contents entries and so on are linked and can be clicked to take you to the corresponding item.
Except for footnote marks, which remain black, all such links are highlighted in either \textcolor{linkcol}{orange} or \textcolor{citecol}{violet}. 
\textcolor{highlightcol}{Red} is used to highlight certain items formulas and diagrams.
The colors \textcolor{definitioncol}{green}, \textcolor{exercisecol}{blue}, and \textcolor{theoremcol}{red} are used as border colors to higlight definitions, exercises, and theorems, propositions, lemmas, etc., respectively.
\textcolor{knowngray}{Gray} is used to convey known or secondary information in formulas and diagrams from place to place.

Demarcations for lecture dates are placed in the righthand margin.
