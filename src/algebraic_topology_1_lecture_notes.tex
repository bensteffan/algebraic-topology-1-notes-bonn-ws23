\section*{About These Notes}
This document encompasses lecture notes for the course \makeatletter\@course\makeatother\ taught in the winter term of 2023/24 at the University of Bonn by \makeatletter\@lecturer\makeatother.
The assistant is \makeatletter\@assistant\makeatother.

These notes are for private use. 
They are \strong{not} official lecture notes endorsed by the lecturer.
As such, errors and inaccuracies that persist are generally my own (unless proven otherwise).

This document is not a character-for-character transcript of the lecture.
Changes to form (though generally not to content) have been made to improve readability of these notes as a document.
In particular, I have taken the liberty to make adjustments to notation here and there to more closely align with my personal tastes and opinions.
At points, I have added additional context, explanations, computations, and so on.
These are clearly marked to that effect, although smaller changes and in-text additions (such as citations) are not.

\subsection*{Formatting}
This document has hyperlinks: References, footnote marks, table-of-contents entries and so on are linked and can be clicked to take you to the corresponding item.
Except for footnote marks, which remain black, all such links are highlighted in either \textcolor{linkcol}{orange} or \textcolor{citecol}{violet}. 
\textcolor{highlightcol}{Red} is used to highlight certain items formulas and diagrams.
The colors \textcolor{definitioncol}{green}, \textcolor{exercisecol}{blue}, and \textcolor{theoremcol}{red} are used as border colors to higlight definitions, exercises, and theorems, propositions, lemmas, etc., respectively.
\textcolor{knowngray}{Gray} is used to convey known or secondary information in formulas and diagrams from place to place.

Demarcations for lecture dates are placed in the righthand margin.
